CONSTRAINTS SATISFIED:
======================

✓ Branch uniquely identified by composite key (branch_number + location)
✓ Vehicle must belong to at least one category
✓ Branch can offer multiple vehicles, vehicles can be at multiple branches
✓ Rental transaction must involve at least one vehicle
✓ Rental transaction associated with exactly one branch and one customer
✓ Employee can manage multiple transactions, each transaction handled by one employee
✓ One invoice generated per rental transaction
✓ Some branches may not offer vehicles initially (partial participation)
✓ Some vehicles may not appear in transactions (partial participation)
✓ Weak entities properly depend on their owner entities

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
=================

1. Branch is identified by the combination of branch_number AND location (composite key)
2. Rental_Transaction is a weak entity that depends on Branch for identification
3. Invoice is a weak entity that depends on Rental_Transaction for identification
4. The system allows multiple vehicles per rental transaction (family rentals)
5. Vehicle categories are stored as simple attributes (not separate entity)
6. Employee position is stored as a simple text attribute
7. Customer address is stored as separate attributes rather than composite
8. Total participation is assumed for Customer→Transaction and Employee→Transaction relationships
