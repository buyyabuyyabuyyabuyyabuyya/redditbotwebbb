Im reaching out for recommendations on resources for UX/UI design principles and practices - I am just getting into web development after 20 years in IT so reasonably proficient in coding, and although I'm very much still learning I can eventually get most technical front end elements down, however I tend to have these odd blocky websites that just look a little \"dated\". I would like to learn some good solid principles for making pages pop, knowing how to use colour palettes properly, and how best to lay items so they look visually appealing (which might include animations, transitions and others). I need to constantly remind myself \"less is more\" as sometimes I swing to the other side of the pendulum and have this funny little \"breathing\" site where everything seems to be doing something and it just feels noisy. \n\nAny good channels, books or videos you'd rate?",
