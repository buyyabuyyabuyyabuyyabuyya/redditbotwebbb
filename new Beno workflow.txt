It’s meant to solve a small pain point I’ve faced a lot: recreating the same UI components over and over.\n\nWith Snap2Code, you can:\n\n* **Save \u0026 reuse** your components across projects\n* **Generate components with AI** instead of writing everything from scratch\n* Hopefully speed up your workflow and cut down on repetitive coding\n\nI’m still figuring things out and would love honest feedback from people who’ve been in the trenches. 🙏\n\n* Do you think this solves a real problem?\n* What features would make it actually useful for you?\n* Any advice for someone new in the SaaS/dev tools space?\n\nfor the product check my profile's post\n\nThanks a lot!

The expectation that people should scroll through 10 pages just to see half the site better is awful.\n\nImagine if we designed restaurant menus like modern websites are designed. Instead of allowing people to see a list of dishes, it would be a book with a dish on every page and a giant image taking up half of each page. People would give up and just order the salad after going through 10 pages, only to be disappointed to learn that there is a burger at page 57 as they are finishing their meal.\n\n\"BuT iT aLLowS pEoPlE to FocuS!!11!!\" Yeah, and I could make people focus way more on Mona Lisa's face by cutting the painting into 9 pieces, showing the one with her face on it in the first room of the museum and then forcing people to walking along a maze of paintings if they want to see the rest. I don't think that necessarily makes the experience any better.\n\nPlease, give me a cramped mid 2000s website with a stupid gif in the corner over this. Because at least I can see the options available.",

Ideally, it would include things like:\n\n* Clean folder structure\n* Reusable components and hooks\n* Thoughtful state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, etc.)\n* Maybe even TypeScript and testing setup\n\nIf anyone knows of a GitHub repo that feels like it was built by someone who’s worked on real products at scale, I’d really appreciate a link!\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

(They didnt develop this website, but similar ones).  \nI know that its definetly not coded with html/css/js. Its impossible (Or will take some much time). But what kind of frameworks or libraries are they using?  \nI know there's Three.js, but that actually is not that easy, something with it still takes time. These kinds of websites to me looks like designed with some visual tool and then transfered into code. Mby someone knows better. I really doubt company employee realy coded it, I don't think they are that advanced, tbh.",

The Storybook docs have a bunch of examples from reputable companies like Audi, the BBC, Atlasian that maintain internal (or even external) component libraries. I'm wondering if anyone has tackled internationalization (language translation) with a shared component library like this? Since you export these components individually, they don't really have a shared App.js or index.js to put a common i18n provider. I'm thinking of two solutions: 1) never have translatable text in your shared components, always pass in text as props and have the consumer worry about internationalization or 2) include internationalization information as a prop and use something like i18next on every exported component.",

(They didnt develop this website, but similar ones).  \nI know that its definetly not coded with html/css/js. Its impossible (Or will take some much time). But what kind of frameworks or libraries are they using?   \nI know there's Three.js, but that actually is not that easy, something with it still takes time. These kinds of websites to me looks like designed with some visual tool and then transfered into code. Mby someone knows better.

I was learning alongside my college studies until I reached a level where I have mastered frontend fundamentals like CSS, HTML, JS, and so on, and I also mastered React and Next.js. I am currently using Next as my main tool. The problem is, until now, I haven't landed any job after applying to almost 210 companies on LinkedIn. I really need help from experts to figure out where the issue is—whether it's on me, if I need to learn more, or if it's a global issue. I would be glad to hear your opinions. Also, here is my portfolio for you to check out. [https://www.salehkamal.shop/](https://www.salehkamal.shop/)",

KISS is the way until it is definitely not, because I feel like it just fails at scale.\n\nExamaple:  \nYou have a data grid, not a table a big datagrid, fairly complex, last column is an actions column, eg. it has a cell where are the fabled three dots that open a context menu with some actions, that you can click on. Now the actions could open a modal, or a dialog confirming an action.\n\nWith declarative approach, you add a \\`useState\\` to each of the buttons, that should open something. Conditionally render the Modal. Cool works, fast, re-renders just the button.  \n  \nNext you can open a detail view modal by clicking on table row. You do the same, add the state to the component row, conditional render it, still fast, although by default it re-renders the whole row.\n\nNext and next and next, you end up at the top of the table, sending open/close functions all over the place, even with a context it sucks, re-rendering or recomputing diffs for the whole table which could have 100 rows and 10 cells for each row, just because you opened a detail modal for single line.\n\nSo what is the preferred solution here? \\`React.memo\\` optimisations all over the place to keep declarative, somehow leverage context to send the open function and state around or reimplement the modal in an imperative way and handle the state within the ModalComponent and add the modal everywhere needed, having multiple strategies on how to open it at hand (refs, render props - passes the inner open function as a function parametr, or \"smart children\" - applies onClick internally)\n\n  \nCurrently I prefer the imperative way, the only downside I see is that the \"wrapping\" ModalComponents renders even though the Modal is not opened and refs might be a little harder to follow (eg. not KISS), however it does not cause re-rerenders of the whole tree. You can basically add this modal to all of these places - the context menu actions, the row and the top of the table, without almost any issue.",

Im reaching out for recommendations on resources for UX/UI design principles and practices - I am just getting into web development after 20 years in IT so reasonably proficient in coding, and although I'm very much still learning I can eventually get most technical front end elements down, however I tend to have these odd blocky websites that just look a little \"dated\". I would like to learn some good solid principles for making pages pop, knowing how to use colour palettes properly, and how best to lay items so they look visually appealing (which might include animations, transitions and others). I need to constantly remind myself \"less is more\" as sometimes I swing to the other side of the pendulum and have this funny little \"breathing\" site where everything seems to be doing something and it just feels noisy. \n\nAny good channels, books or videos you'd rate?",

It’s meant to solve a small pain point I’ve faced a lot: recreating the same UI components over and over.\n\nWith Snap2Code, you can:\n\n* **Save \u0026 reuse** your components across projects\n* **Generate components with AI** instead of writing everything from scratch\n* Hopefully speed up your workflow and cut down on repetitive coding\n\nI’m still figuring things out and would love honest feedback from people who’ve been in the trenches. 🙏\n\n* Do you think this solves a real problem?\n* What features would make it actually useful for you?\n* Any advice for someone new in the SaaS/dev tools space?\n\nfor the product check my profile's post\n\nThanks a lot!

The expectation that people should scroll through 10 pages just to see half the site better is awful.\n\nImagine if we designed restaurant menus like modern websites are designed. Instead of allowing people to see a list of dishes, it would be a book with a dish on every page and a giant image taking up half of each page. People would give up and just order the salad after going through 10 pages, only to be disappointed to learn that there is a burger at page 57 as they are finishing their meal.\n\n\"BuT iT aLLowS pEoPlE to FocuS!!11!!\" Yeah, and I could make people focus way more on Mona Lisa's face by cutting the painting into 9 pieces, showing the one with her face on it in the first room of the museum and then forcing people to walking along a maze of paintings if they want to see the rest. I don't think that necessarily makes the experience any better.\n\nPlease, give me a cramped mid 2000s website with a stupid gif in the corner over this. Because at least I can see the options available.",

Ideally, it would include things like:\n\n* Clean folder structure\n* Reusable components and hooks\n* Thoughtful state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, etc.)\n* Maybe even TypeScript and testing setup\n\nIf anyone knows of a GitHub repo that feels like it was built by someone who’s worked on real products at scale, I’d really appreciate a link!\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

Cause there's a job offer and the company makes websites with everything animated with advanced visuals... (They didnt develop this website, but similar ones).  \nI know that its definetly not coded with html/css/js. Its impossible (Or will take some much time). But what kind of frameworks or libraries are they using?  \nI know there's Three.js, but that actually is not that easy, something with it still takes time. These kinds of websites to me looks like designed with some visual tool and then transfered into code. Mby someone knows better. I really doubt company employee realy coded it, I don't think they are that advanced, tbh.",

The Storybook docs have a bunch of examples from reputable companies like Audi, the BBC, Atlasian that maintain internal (or even external) component libraries. I'm wondering if anyone has tackled internationalization (language translation) with a shared component library like this? Since you export these components individually, they don't really have a shared App.js or index.js to put a common i18n provider. I'm thinking of two solutions: 1) never have translatable text in your shared components, always pass in text as props and have the consumer worry about internationalization or 2) include internationalization information as a prop and use something like i18next on every exported component.",

(They didnt develop this website, but similar ones).  \nI know that its definetly not coded with html/css/js. Its impossible (Or will take some much time). But what kind of frameworks or libraries are they using?   \nI know there's Three.js, but that actually is not that easy, something with it still takes time. These kinds of websites to me looks like designed with some visual tool and then transfered into code. Mby someone knows better.

I was learning alongside my college studies until I reached a level where I have mastered frontend fundamentals like CSS, HTML, JS, and so on, and I also mastered React and Next.js. I am currently using Next as my main tool. The problem is, until now, I haven't landed any job after applying to almost 210 companies on LinkedIn. I really need help from experts to figure out where the issue is—whether it's on me, if I need to learn more, or if it's a global issue. I would be glad to hear your opinions.

KISS is the way until it is definitely not, because I feel like it just fails at scale.\n\nExamaple:  \nYou have a data grid, not a table a big datagrid, fairly complex, last column is an actions column, eg. it has a cell where are the fabled three dots that open a context menu with some actions, that you can click on. Now the actions could open a modal, or a dialog confirming an action.\n\nWith declarative approach, you add a \\`useState\\` to each of the buttons, that should open something. Conditionally render the Modal. Cool works, fast, re-renders just the button.  \n  \nNext you can open a detail view modal by clicking on table row. You do the same, add the state to the component row, conditional render it, still fast, although by default it re-renders the whole row.\n\nNext and next and next, you end up at the top of the table, sending open/close functions all over the place, even with a context it sucks, re-rendering or recomputing diffs for the whole table which could have 100 rows and 10 cells for each row, just because you opened a detail modal for single line.\n\nSo what is the preferred solution here? \\`React.memo\\` optimisations all over the place to keep declarative, somehow leverage context to send the open function and state around or reimplement the modal in an imperative way and handle the state within the ModalComponent and add the modal everywhere needed, having multiple strategies on how to open it at hand (refs, render props - passes the inner open function as a function parametr, or \"smart children\" - applies onClick internally)\n\n  \nCurrently I prefer the imperative way, the only downside I see is that the \"wrapping\" ModalComponents renders even though the Modal is not opened and refs might be a little harder to follow (eg. not KISS), however it does not cause re-rerenders of the whole tree. You can basically add this modal to all of these places - the context menu actions, the row and the top of the table, without almost any issue.",

Im reaching out for recommendations on resources for UX/UI design principles and practices - I am just getting into web development after 20 years in IT so reasonably proficient in coding, and although I'm very much still learning I can eventually get most technical front end elements down, however I tend to have these odd blocky websites that just look a little \"dated\". I would like to learn some good solid principles for making pages pop, knowing how to use colour palettes properly, and how best to lay items so they look visually appealing (which might include animations, transitions and others). I need to constantly remind myself \"less is more\" as sometimes I swing to the other side of the pendulum and have this funny little \"breathing\" site where everything seems to be doing something and it just feels noisy. \n\nAny good channels, books or videos you'd rate?",

Im reaching out for recommendations on resources for UX/UI design principles and practices - I am just getting into web development after 20 years in IT so reasonably proficient in coding, and although I'm very much still learning I can eventually get most technical front end elements down, however I tend to have these odd blocky websites that just look a little \"dated\". I would like to learn some good solid principles for making pages pop, knowing how to use colour palettes properly, and how best to lay items so they look visually appealing (which might include animations, transitions and others). I need to constantly remind myself \"less is more\" as sometimes I swing to the other side of the pendulum and have this funny little \"breathing\" site where everything seems to be doing something and it just feels noisy. \n\nAny good channels, books or videos you'd rate?",
