Hi there,If Reddit is part of your growth mix, you’ll like this. I’ve built RedditOutreach — a simple way to scale targeted Reddit messaging without the manual grind. In a few minutes you can connect an account, pick subreddits and keywords, and start sending personalized DMs automatically.What you get:

Being able to connect multiple bot accounts to parallelize safely

Custom message templates with dynamic variables like {username} and {subreddit}

AI-powered content analysis to match keywords and sentiment for higher relevance

Instant subreddit scan to message fresh posts immediately

Bot-specific live logs and detailed analytics to track performance

Pricing is simple with a free tier to try:

Free: 1 account, 15 messages (one-time), 1 template, 1 scan config

Pro: 3 accounts, 200 messages/month, advanced analytics (limited-time $7.99/mo)

Advanced: Unlimited accounts, messages, templates, and scan configs (limited-time $13.99/mo)

See how it works and get started free here: https://RedditOutreach.com



Hey Buyya, Thanks for reaching out! We might be interested in working with you. Internally in Gentura we have been also experimenting with Reddit outreach, I'd say quite successfully, most of our beta clients came from Reddit. For outreach we used Reddit's new chat feature, I made a script locally that spinned up the headless browser and sent out custom messages to those who left their business domains in r/Saas. As I understand you are using Reddit's API to send out the PM's right? Would it be of interest to you to work on creating bots that send out messages through chats? I would be willing to pay base 500-1000 USD for such custom plan + bonuses.  Looking forward to hearing what you think.

Cheers, Vlad

to Lennar


Hi Lennar, Quick notes: - Reddit removed private messages; we use Chats only. - Accounts: I can use your account, or supply aged accounts (1–4 years) and give you access. I still recommend using a single account so prospects see a consistent identity. - Risk: any account can be flagged. Using older/high‑karma accounts and conservative daily limits keeps risk low. To scope and price within your $500–$1,000 base (+ bonus), could you confirm: - Messages per day and pilot length (e.g., 2–4 weeks) - Target subreddits and keywords; copy: yours or should I draft 2 variants?   • How keywords work: we scan new posts in your chosen subreddits and open a chat when the title/body matches. An AI filter does a final relevance check before sending. - Where should replies go (email/Slack/CRM)?   • You can also manage all chats in the RedditOutreach dashboard; I can provision one account for you with full access. - What counts as a qualified reply/meeting/signup for the bonus? Best, Buyya

to me


Hey Buyya,  Thanks for the quick reply!  I would like to use around 10 accounts. With my personal account I was able to send around 100 messages per day without hitting the limit. I guess less "real" accounts would hit the limit faster.  Ideally I would like to send around 1000 messages per day. Many different subreddits. Strategy I used previously was to target users who left a comment with a link to their businesses' landing page. Then my bot went to their landing page, scraped the page, and made a custom message complimenting their business, that was the start of the chat. I'm open to different strategies.  Not sure yet what's the best way to manage the replies. Planning to find a person who would be responsible for customer support.  Signup would count as a bonus. We'd be willing to pay 20%-30% if somebody subs through your system. Our subs cost 200 USD.  What if we then start with just one account, I will test your system/dashboard, and then we'll see if we can scale it? If you think that's a good idea please provide me with one aged account, feel free to charge whatever you think is fair.  Cheers, Vlad






Hi Lennar,

Thanks for the thoughtful note — starting with one account sounds perfect, then we’ll scale.

How we’ll run

We only target new subreddit posts (not comments). We scan posts and use AI to decide if they’re a fit, then open a chat using your template.

Avoid links in the first chat — Reddit often flags/obscures them. Let’s prompt a reply first, then share links later.

Account + limits: 9‑year account (~4k karma), throttled around 17.8 msgs/hour. Your RedditOutreach Plan is on the Unlimited plan, so you won’t hit app limits.

Login into Redditoutreach.com: Email- buyyav19@gmail.com /  password - buyya123456789

Replies: we’ll keep all reply handling inside RedditOutreach/messages .

Scaling later

To run 10 accounts concurrently, we’ll attach a dedicated proxy per account. I’m adding proxy support Soon; we can start with this single account immediately and expand as soon as it’s live.

You can keep any account we dedicate to you. For comparable aged accounts, a reasonable ballpark is $60–$150 each depending on age/karma/history; I’ll confirm specifics before we add more.

Could you send me a few things so I can personalize and launch?

3–4 sentences on Gentura: what you do, ideal customer, website link, and your CTA (book a call, signup, demo), when I get this info I will make the Template.

Subreddits you want to target (you choose).

5–10 positive keywords and any to avoid, or if you want to send a message to every user that is possible(we can just use normal words like: the, a, App).

And what should the user have for us to send a message to them? talking about their APP, Asking for a solution with their problem?. This will be for the AI relevance check in RedditOutreach

A starter opener you like (or I can draft two options for approval).

Pilot volume and length (e.g., 100/day for 7–14 days).

Once I have those, I’ll load everything into your dashboard and kick off the pilot.

Best, Buyya
